"""Resolve one regulatory view per scenario (Task 2R component 2).

`scenarios.json` carries a partial `regulatory_overrides` object per scenario —
just the fields that scenario changes relative to the base `regulations.json`
(which already represents the "approved_text" position). This module merges
the two into one concrete, `regulations.json`-shaped view per scenario, so
downstream consumers (component 3's solver, and `scope_gating.applicable_regimes`)
read a single resolved dict and never need an `if scenario_id == ...` branch.
