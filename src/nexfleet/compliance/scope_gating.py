"""Scope-gating engine (Task 2; PLAN.md §3.4, §5.4, Phase 4 pulled forward).

Given a vessel, its voyage pattern, and a year, decides which of the four
regimes (CII, NZF, FuelEU, EU ETS) apply and at what voyage share — pure logic,
no ML, no data dependency beyond `regulations.json`. Every threshold (GT
boundary, regime start year, voyage-share weights, EU ETS phase-in) is read
from `regulations.json`, never inlined here, so a regulatory constant only
ever needs updating in one place.

No band-specific branching exists in this module: PLAN.md §5.4's Band A/B/C
outcomes (see docs/scope_matrix.md) fall out of the general formula below —
e.g. Band B's "CII+NZF only" is a consequence of its voyage having zero EU/EEA
exposure, not a special case coded for that band.
