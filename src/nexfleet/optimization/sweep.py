"""Carbon-price sweep + switching-point extraction (Task 2R component 4,
prototype version — implements PLAN.md §3.6).

The sweep clamps the **effective marginal carbon price** (the §3.6 axis, in
USD/tCO2e), not scenario identity: at each grid point we build a synthetic
resolved-regulations view where NZF's two-tier deficit structure collapses to
one uniform price, solve the fleet plan under it (warm-started from the
neighboring grid point's best genome — component 3's `solver.run_ga` already
supports this via `seed_genome`), and record where each vessel-year's optimal
decision changes as price rises. That set of changes is the switching-point
table; PLAN.md §3.6's scenario ticks (`scenario_axis_positions`) mark where
each of the K=5 live proposals — plus EU ETS's own real, always-on price —
actually sits on that same axis, so the gap between a tick and a switching
point is the demo's "bet distance."

Everything here consumes component 3's already-tested primitives
(`solver.run_ga`, `objective.vessel_year_facts`, `compliance_cost.nzf_gaps`,
`implied_price.fueleu_implied_price`) rather than re-deriving fuel/regime
logic — this module's own job is the grid loop, the switching-point diff, and
the scenario-axis bookkeeping around them.

    Fixes a real, verified GA search-quality problem: with only NZF's
    tier/surplus prices varying (via `_nzf_price_override`), the unwarmed
    price=0 solve has no NZF-driven pressure to explore the "switch several
    vessels to LNG/methanol" region of genome space, even though that
    switch would *also* reduce this fleet's always-on, price-independent EU
    ETS and FuelEU costs -- a co-benefit a price=0 cold solve has no reason
    to go looking for, but a solve run at a higher price (and then
    warm-started backward) can stumble into. On this fleet, correcting for
    that alone closed a genuine 17%, $63M full-grid cost inversion down to
    a smooth, single-digit-basis-point residual.

    IMPORTANT caveat, confirmed by direct inspection on this fleet, not
    assumed: fixing a genome, total cost is *not* guaranteed non-decreasing
    in price in general. `_nzf_price_override` pegs NZF's surplus-unit
    credit 1:1 to the same swept price as the deficit-tier penalty (a
    documented sweep simplification -- see that function's own docstring).
    A genome whose fleet-wide NZF balance is a net *surplus* (this fleet's
    optimum is, at every grid point checked) earns a bigger credit as price
    rises, so its total cost genuinely *falls* with price -- that is
    correct economics given the model's stated assumptions, not a defect.
    So: this function guarantees each grid point's total_usd is the true
    minimum over every *already-discovered* genome at that grid point's
    price (a real, provable envelope-tightening operation, verified as an
    invariant by `test_sweep.py`) -- it does NOT guarantee the resulting
    curve is monotonically non-decreasing, because for a net-surplus fleet
    the economically correct curve isn't. Read grid_points[].total_usd
    accordingly, and see `envelope_corrected`/`envelope_source_price_usd_
    per_tco2e` for which points were actually revised.

    This performs no new search: it only re-evaluates genomes the GA
    already found, via `objective.evaluate` (a pure function), against
    every grid point's own regulations -- O(N^2) evaluations across N grid
    points, sub-second even at N~40, versus the GA runs that produced the
    genomes. Every number that comes out the other side remains a real,
    feasible, GA-discovered configuration's real cost -- nothing here
    invents or smooths a value; it only picks the best *already-computed*
    one for each price.

    step (especially the first one, off a single cold solve) can instead be
    the search still settling rather than the true optimum changing. Band C
    vessel-years are filtered out for exactly this reason (see
