"""Generic Matrix Product State / Born-machine linear algebra.

Fleet-agnostic on purpose — no `nexfleet.fleet` or `nexfleet.regulatory`
imports here. This module is the actual mathematics PLAN.md §1.3 and §3.1
describe and DESIGN_NOTE_POOLING.md assumes exists: a real quantum-many-body
representation of a probability distribution, not a classically-flavoured
proxy that borrows the vocabulary.

Two operations, both textbook:

- `tt_svd` — the Tensor-Train / Matrix Product State decomposition
  (Oseledets 2011): sequential SVD sweeps that turn an n-dimensional array
  into a chain of 3-index cores. Exact when no `max_bond` truncation is
  requested (every singular value kept), which is this module's default —
  truncation only matters once the joint tensor is large enough to need
  compressing, which is explicitly out of scope for `mps_exposure.py`'s
  current per-vessel-year scale (see that module's docstring).
- `mutual_information` — PLAN §3.1's own definition, implemented literally:
  "mutual information between two subsystems of a quantum state ... obtained
  here from the singular value spectrum at the relevant bond." Given a joint
  probability tensor, this builds the Born-machine amplitude state
  `ψ = sqrt(P)` (Han et al. 2018 — the same object PLAN.md names throughout),
  which is a valid normalized quantum state in the computational basis
  because `Σ P = 1 ⇒ Σ ψ² = 1`, then computes `S(ρ_A) + S(ρ_B) − S(ρ_AB)`
  from the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrices obtained by
  contracting `ψψ†` down to each subsystem.

    - `cores[i]` has shape `(left_bond, tensor.shape[i], right_bond)` (the
      first core's left bond and the last core's right bond are both 1).
      Contracting the full chain over the bond indices reproduces `tensor`
      exactly when `max_bond` is `None` (verified by

      bond, and are what `von_neumann_entropy` and `mutual_information`
      consume.

    `max_bond`, if given, truncates each SVD to its top `max_bond` singular
    values — standard MPS bond-dimension truncation. Left `None` by every
    caller in this codebase today (see module docstring); implemented here

    need it, but a full-fleet-scale MPS (Track F) would.

    `joint_probs` must be a non-negative array summing to 1 (a genuine
    probability tensor over every axis, not just the two of interest) —
    this is what makes `ψ` a normalized quantum state and the resulting
    quantity a real entanglement-entropy-based mutual information, not a
    renamed classical formula. Axes other than `axis_a`/`axis_b` are traced
    out exactly (`_reduced_density_matrix`), so correlations mediated
    through a third axis are correctly folded into `ρ_AB` before entropy is
    taken.

    Equivalent, for a strict two-block bipartition, to taking the entropy of
    `tt_svd`'s bond singular-value spectrum at that bond (`eigenvalues of
    ρ = AA^T` are exactly the squared singular values of the amplitude
    matrix `A`) — implemented here via direct eigendecomposition of the
    reduced density matrix instead, because that is what generalizes to the
    non-adjacent axis pairs `mps_exposure.py` needs (a bare MPS bond only
    ever bipartitions the chain into two contiguous halves).

    **A documented subtlety, not a bug:** when `axis_a`/`axis_b` are the
    *only* two axes in `joint_probs` (no other axis to trace out), `ρ_AB`
    is the full pure state and always has `S(ρ_AB) = 0`, which makes this
    reduce to `2·S(ρ_A)` for a deterministic A↔B relationship — not the
    classical Shannon `I(A;B) = H(A)`. This is standard quantum-information
    behaviour for a bipartite pure state, not a defect of this
    implementation, and `test_tensor_network.py` tests it explicitly rather
    than silently relying on it. It matches classical Shannon MI once a
    third "which-outcome" axis is present to purify the pair into a
    genuinely mixed `ρ_AB` (also tested) — which is the normal case for
    `mps_exposure.py`'s real, many-axis tensors, where every other decision
    field plays that role.
