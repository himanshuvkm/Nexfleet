"""Hard and soft constraints (Task 2R component 3, item 2).

Compatibility masks (fuel/engine-type) are already enforced by
`nexfleet.fleet.model.option_menu_for` (component 2) — not re-implemented
here. This module covers the two constraints component 3 adds:

- **Schedule reliability (speed floor)**: a true hard mask, applied in
  `genome.py`'s sampling (never generating the two slowest of 8 bands) rather
  than by shrinking `option_menu_for`'s own output, which stays 8 bands to
  preserve component 2's already-committed contract and tests.
- **Demand constraint**: a softer, explicitly-ILLUSTRATIVE constraint (per
  the task's own framing) — a large penalty rather than outright rejection,
  since under-serving a route-year is a modelling simplification's failure
  mode, not a regulatory hard invariant.
