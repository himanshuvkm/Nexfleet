on `genome.py`'s own explicit-`random.Random` operators rather than DEAP's

through one seeded `random.Random` instance, and mixing in DEAP's
global-state operators here would quietly break that guarantee.

    vessel-year slot (in a shuffled order, using the same seeded `rng` as
    everything else in this module) and try every single-field variant of
    it (`_gene_field_candidates`), holding every other slot fixed, keeping
    whichever variant strictly lowers total cost. Repeat until a full sweep
    makes no improvement, or `max_sweeps` is reached.

    `max_sweeps` is a safety cap, not the intended stopping rule -- the
    descent normally converges (a sweep with no improvement) well inside it.
    It was 2, chosen when a full sweep was expensive; `objective.ObjectiveCache`
    made `evaluate` ~4.6x cheaper for exactly this access pattern (one field
    changed at a time), so the cap is now high enough that the descent
    actually reaches its own fixed point instead of being cut off mid-way.

    Why this exists: on this fleet, a population/generation-bounded GA over
    a ~50-slot genome verifiably leaves individual slots at a locally
    suboptimal value even when the population's fitness looks converged --
    a vessel's own year-over-year fuel choice could reverse toward a
    dirtier fuel with no cost benefit, purely because the GA's crossover/
    mutation never happened to try the strictly-better single-slot swap for
    that one vessel-year. This is not a new search over the whole genome:
    it is an exhaustive check of "does any one-slot change help," applied
    slot by slot until none does. Cheap -- `evaluate()` calls only, no GA
    -- and every candidate comes from that slot's own `option_menu_for`
    menu, so it can never introduce an infeasible value.

    `reference_genome`, when given, adds a final **canonicalization** pass
    once the descent has converged: any field whose value could be set back
    to the reference plan's value without changing total cost by more than
    `DEGENERATE_COST_TOLERANCE_USD` is set back. This does not search and
    cannot make the plan worse -- it only picks, among plans this model
    prices *identically*, the one closest to a stated reference.

    Why that matters, concretely: on this fleet 89 of the 585 single-field
    changes off a solved genome are exactly cost-neutral, and they are
    entirely `pool_opt_in`/`borrow_election` bits on vessel-years with no
    FuelEU balance for them to act on. Left arbitrary, those ~89 free bits
    are re-rolled by every independent solve, so a sweep's adjacent grid
    points disagree on them for no economic reason at all -- and
    `sweep.extract_switching_points`, which diffs adjacent genomes, reports
    each disagreement as a switching point. That is the dominant source of
    the "is this real signal or search noise?" problem `run_sweep`'s own
    docstring already warns about. Canonicalizing against the neighbouring
    grid point's plan removes exactly that noise and nothing else: a field
    the price genuinely moved differs by far more than the tolerance and is
    left where the search put it.
