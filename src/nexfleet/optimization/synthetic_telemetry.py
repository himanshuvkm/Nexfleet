"""Synthetic fuel-consumption telemetry generator (PS Objective 1 / PLAN.md
§5 Phase 2's data pipeline).

**No real telemetry exists in this repo.** PLAN.md's Phase 1 (THETIS-MRV /
AIS / ERA5 ingestion) is unbuilt — `fleet.json` carries only class-level
static anchor figures (one illustrative daily-energy number per vessel band),
never a per-voyage or per-timestamp record. This module generates a
*documented* synthetic ground truth instead, so the prediction-benchmark
machinery (feature engineering, leave-one-vessel-out CV, honest MAPE/R²
reporting, the residual-model construction in `fuel_predictors.py`) is real
and runnable now, and would apply directly to real telemetry the day Phase 1
exists — the numeric *results* this produces are prototype-grade, not a
claim about real-world model accuracy, exactly as this codebase already
labels every other synthetic figure (`fleet.json`'s own `"ILLUSTRATIVE"`
anchor-energy fields, `docs/PLAN.md` §6.2).

**Each sample is a synthetic annual fuel-consumption observation**, not a
literal daily log entry: `nexfleet.optimization.fuel_model.PhysicsFuelModel.
fuel_consumption_tonnes` already computes an *annual* total for a fixed
(route, speed, fuel, year) — the same units the `FuelModel` protocol's
consumers (`objective.py`, `sweep.py`, `exposure.py`) already expect. Rather
than inventing a separate "daily" concept those consumers don't use, each
sample here is one plausible annual outcome for a vessel-year under one
sampled (speed, fuel, route, hull-fouling age, sea-state) combination — an
ensemble of "what a full year at this operating point would have burned",
not a time series. This keeps `TelemetrySample.physics_tonnes` in exactly
the units `fuel_predictors.py`'s `FuelModel`-conformant residual predictors
need to correct.

**The residual has structured, learnable signal on purpose** — two
documented drift terms physics doesn't capture, plus bounded gaussian noise:

- **Hull-fouling age** (`hull_fouling_age_days`, 0 to `MAX_FOULING_AGE_DAYS`
  since a synthetic last drydock): drag — and therefore fuel burn — rises
  roughly linearly with fouling age; `hull_fouling_fraction` implements that
  as a fraction of `physics_tonnes`, capped at `MAX_FOULING_RESIDUAL_FRACTION`.
  Its *mean* is band-conditional (`_BAND_MEAN_FOULING_AGE_DAYS`) — deep-sea
  Band A vessels are given a longer typical drydock interval than Band C
  coastal feeders, an illustrative but directionally realistic maintenance-
  cadence difference — so vessel band carries real signal for this term.
- **Sea state** (`sea_state_index`, 0-1): a weather/current proxy. Its mean
  is nudged upward for longer, more open-ocean routes (derived from
  `fleet.json`'s own `distance_nm` — not a new hardcoded per-route table).
  Its *effect* on fuel burn is additionally scaled up at higher speed
  (`_speed_amplification`) — added resistance in a seaway grows faster than
  linearly with speed, a real hydrodynamic effect — so there is a genuine
  route x speed interaction here, not just a per-route additive offset.
- Gaussian measurement/engine-condition noise, `NOISE_STD_FRACTION` of
  `physics_tonnes`, irreducible by any model (the honest error floor).

**What a model can and cannot learn from this, stated plainly.** The
`FuelModel` protocol's `fuel_consumption_tonnes(vessel, fleet, year,
speed_knots, fuel_id, route_id)` signature has no slot for hull-fouling age
or sea state — the live solver has no such decision variable, and this
module's residual predictors (`fuel_predictors.py`) must stay conformant to
that exact signature to remain drop-in-compatible with `objective.evaluate`
and everything downstream of it. So a predictor is trained *and evaluated*
using only what that signature actually provides (band, route, fuel, speed,
year) — it can learn the band- and route-conditional *mean* of the fouling
and sea-state terms (real, systematic, learnable), and the speed-conditional
amplification of the sea-state term (real, nonlinear, learnable), but it
cannot and should not be expected to predict the zero-mean noise within
those terms or the explicit gaussian term — that part is the honest error
floor, the same way a real deployment averaging over unmeasured weather on
a given day would face it too.

A model that can approximate the *learnable* part of this generating
process will beat physics-only on this data — the residual is synthetic and
its structure is known to whoever wrote it. That is not a hidden weakness:
it is stated here, in the benchmark report
(`scripts/benchmark_fuel_predictor.py`), and in every consumer of this
module's output, exactly once, plainly.
