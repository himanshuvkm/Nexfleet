"""Genome representation and operators (Task 2R component 3, item 3).

A flat list of per-(vessel, year) genes, each drawn only from that
vessel-year's own `option_menu_for` output (component 2) — structurally
infeasible values cannot be constructed, so mutation and crossover never
need a repair step (feasibility is closed under both operators: crossover
only ever recombines already-valid slot values, and mutation only ever
resamples a slot from its own valid menu).

DEAP-independent by design — these are plain functions over plain data, so
they're directly unit-testable without pulling in DEAP's machinery.
`solver.py` wraps them into a DEAP toolbox.
