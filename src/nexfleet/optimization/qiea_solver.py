"""A Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Algorithm (QIEA) solver — an alternative
to `solver.run_ga`'s classical genetic algorithm, over the same genome,
constraints, and objective.

Han & Kim (2002) — the QIEA baseline PLAN.md §4/§5 Phase 5 already names as
a benchmark comparator — represent each decision as a *qubit*: a pair of
probability amplitudes `(α, β)`, `|α|² + |β|² = 1`, describing a superposition
over the two binary outcomes. Each generation, every individual's qubits are
*observed* (collapsed) into a classical bit string, evaluated, and then
rotated via a **Q-gate** toward the best solution found so far — the
population converges by reshaping a distribution, not by discarding
individuals.

This module is the same mechanism generalized from **qubits to qudits**:
`VesselYearGene`'s fields are categorical (a route, a speed-band index, a
fuel, three booleans), not binary, so each field gets its own probability
vector over its own domain (`genome.field_domains`, built from the same
`option_menu_for` / `allowed_speed_band_indices` sources `genome.py`'s own
`random_gene` samples from, so every observed value is structurally valid;
no repair step, matching that module's existing feasibility-closure design).
Han & Kim's original Q-gate is defined by an 8-row lookup table over
two-outcome qubits specifically and does not extend verbatim to a k-outcome
qudit; the rotation implemented here (`_rotate_toward`) is the standard
generalization used in multi-valued/EDA-style QIEA work — nudge probability
mass toward the global best's realized value at that slot, renormalizing the
rest — which is the continuous-probability limit of what Han-Kim's rotation
does for `k=2`. This is a real, previously-published mechanism, not a
rename of the GA already in `solver.py`.

Returns `solver.SolverResult` — the existing dataclass, not a parallel type
— so this is a drop-in alternative to `run_ga` wherever it's called
(`sweep.solve_scenario`, `exposure.py`'s per-scenario solves), without any
change to those modules.

**Tuning pass, post-benchmark (`outputs/optimizer_benchmark.md`'s first run):**
at matched population/generation budgets, this lost to the GA by ~35% on
total cost and found zero switching points, with 10/11 sweep grid points
needing their answer borrowed from elsewhere (`sweep._apply_monotonic_
envelope`) because the QIEA solve itself wasn't competitive. Root cause,
diagnosed rather than guessed: every quantum individual rotated toward the
*single* population-wide global best every generation. On a ~50-slot
genome, that collapses the whole population onto one attractor within a
handful of generations, well before the registers have explored enough of
the space to know that attractor is any good — the qualitative opposite of
a GA's crossover, which recombines building blocks from *many* good
parents. Three changes were made to address this:

1. **Elite archive, not a single global best** (`_EliteArchive`): every
   generation's *entire* observed batch is folded into a small
   (deduplicated, capped) pool of the best distinct genomes found so far,
   and each individual's rotation target is a weighted-random pick from it
   rather than always the one incumbent best.
2. **Annealed rotation rate**, not a constant one (`rotation_learning_rate`
   -> `rotation_learning_rate_end`): starts low, ramps up linearly, the same
   explore-then-exploit shape a simulated-annealing temperature schedule
   uses.
3. **The same coordinate-descent polish `solver.py`'s GA already runs**
   (`_local_search_refine`) — cheap (`evaluate()` calls only, no search),
   and this codebase already has direct evidence it closes real per-slot
   convergence gaps a finite-budget population search leaves behind. There
   was no principled reason QIEA shouldn't get the same free win the GA
   already gets from it, so it now does.

**Honest result of the ablation (`outputs/qiea_tuning_ablation.md`), not the
story the numbered list above would suggest:** items 1 and 2, together,
closed only a fraction of the gap on their own (~$481M vs GA's ~$380M at
matched seed/budget) — the elite archive alone was mildly *worse* than the
single-global-best baseline it replaced (~$558M vs ~$522M), and annealing
alone helped only partially (~$461M). **Item 3, on its own, closed
essentially the entire gap** (~$378M, matching GA almost exactly). All three
stay in the default configuration because combined they still match GA and
don't measurably hurt — but the honest headline is that the search-side
redesign (1, 2) is not what fixed this. It's documented here as tested and
available, not proven to matter at this problem's scale, rather than
overstated as the win.

All three are additive and keyword-defaulted; nothing about `run_qiea`'s
signature contract or `SolverResult` return shape changed.

**Second pass (`outputs/optimizer_tuning_round2.md`).** Nothing about the
QIEA *search* changed again; three changes elsewhere, all shared with the GA,
moved this from "loses to GA" to "narrowly beats GA" on the same benchmark:
`objective.ObjectiveCache` (~4.6x cheaper `evaluate`), which bought enough
budget for `solver._local_search_refine`'s coordinate descent to run to its
own fixed point instead of being cut off at two sweeps; the register
representation here dropping numpy for plain lists (58% of a generation's
wall time was numpy dispatch on 2-6-element vectors); and
`solver._canonicalize_against`'s cost-tied tie-break, which cut this
solver's reported switching points from 146 to 52 with no change to any
cost. The attribution from the first pass therefore stands and strengthens:
the polish step, not the quantum-inspired search, is what makes this
solver's numbers good.

**Third pass — the search itself (`outputs/qiea_search_round3.md`).** The open
question after round 2 was what the quantum-inspired half actually contributes,
given that this solver still lost 8 of 11 sweep grid points to a borrowed
genome while the GA lost none. Three interventions were tried and measured:

- **Mean-field initialization (`mean_field_init`, kept, default on).** Rather
  than starting every register uniform, each is initialized to the Boltzmann
  marginals of that vessel-year's own *separable* cost table
  (`objective.slot_local_total_usd`, enumerated over the slot's route x speed
  x fuel x shore-power domain). This is the one thing the qudit representation
  buys that a population of point-valued genomes structurally cannot: a
  distribution per decision, seedable with everything the separable part of
  the objective already knows before any plan is evaluated -- a mean-field
  product state, which the search then refines against the coupled part
  (FuelEU pooling, the demand constraint) that no product state can express.
  **Measured: the raw search (`polish=False`, 8 seeds) improves 11.2%, mean
  $497.6M -> $441.9M, with non-overlapping ranges** (worst case 517.9 -> 453.8,
  best 477.8 -> 411.7). That is the largest effect any change has had on this
  solver's own search.
- **Per-individual attractor (Han & Kim's `b_j`) with periodic global
  migration: tried, measurably worse, removed.** Raw search 3.2% worse than
  the shared-archive baseline, and worse on the sweep. Not kept, despite being
  the more faithful reading of the original paper.
- **Warm-start breadth (`_warm_start_population`): kept, but not claimed.**
  This module warm-started 1 individual in 40 where `solver._seeded_population`
  warm-starts 11 -- an unintended asymmetry, since the sweep is almost entirely
  warm solves. Closing it is free but measured within noise end to end.

**The honest headline, and it is a limit rather than a win:** that 11.2%
raw-search gain does *not* reach the output. End to end, with the
coordinate-descent polish on, mean total cost over 30 warm re-solves moves by
~0.04% -- inside run-to-run noise. The polish is dominant enough on this
problem that it erases an 11% difference in what the search hands it. So the
quantum-inspired representation demonstrably does something a genetic
population cannot, and on *this* problem at *these* budgets it does not
matter. Both halves of that sentence are measured, and the second one is the
reason not to present this solver as beating the GA because of its physics.

    Deterministic for a fixed `seed`: every random draw (registers'
    observation, mutation, elite-archive pick) comes from one
    `random.Random(seed)` instance, matching `solver.py`'s own discipline.

    `seed_genome`, when given, warm-starts one individual's registers
    partway toward it (`_bias_toward_genome`) rather than a full population
    reset — comparable in spirit to `solver._seeded_population`.

    `rotation_learning_rate` is the *starting* rate; if `rotation_learning_
    rate_end` is given (the default), the rate anneals linearly to it across
    `n_generations` (see module docstring for why). Pass
    `rotation_learning_rate_end=None` for the old flat-rate behaviour.
    `elite_archive_size` bounds the multi-attractor pool `_apply_q_gate`
    draws rotation targets from (`_EliteArchive`) — `1` recovers the
    original single-global-best behaviour. `polish=False` skips the final
    coordinate-descent pass (`solver._local_search_refine`) if a caller
    wants the raw QIEA output for its own sake (e.g. isolating the search's
    own contribution in a benchmark).
