"""Fuel-consumption residual predictors (PS Objective 1 / experiment B1).

Four `FuelModel`-conformant arms, matching PLAN.md's own B1 comparator
table (physics baseline, tensor-train residual, LightGBM, plain MLP):

- `nexfleet.optimization.fuel_model.PhysicsFuelModel` — reused as-is, the
  zero-residual baseline every other arm is measured against.
- `LightGbmResidualFuelModel` — the "honest strong baseline" (PLAN.md's own
  framing of LightGBM throughout §3.3).
- `MlpResidualFuelModel` — PLAN.md names this explicitly alongside LightGBM.
- `TensorTrainResidualFuelModel` — reuses `tensor_network.tt_svd` /
  `reconstruct_from_cores` (already in this codebase, already tested)
  rather than a new dependency: fits an empirical mean-residual table over
  a small discretized (band, route, fuel, speed-bin) grid, TT-decomposes
  it with real SVD-based truncation, and predicts from the reconstructed
  (compressed, denoised) table. This is a genuine tensor-train
  decomposition of a real residual table — not the decision-focused,
  quantile-trained tensor-train PLAN.md §5 Phase 2 describes as Track-F
  scale; that distinction is stated once here and not overclaimed.

Every arm delegates `annual_energy_mj`/`daily_energy_mj` to an internal
`PhysicsFuelModel` unchanged and only ever *corrects* `fuel_consumption_
tonnes` — see `synthetic_telemetry.py`'s module docstring for the full
reasoning (physics stays the energy authority every regulatory calculation
downstream depends on; only fuel mass gets a learned correction) and for
exactly which features a predictor may see at inference time (band, route,
fuel, speed, year — the `FuelModel` protocol's own signature, nothing else;
hull-fouling age and sea state are deliberately not available here).
