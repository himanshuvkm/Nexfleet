"""FuelEU pooling economics (Task 2R component 3) — the headline mechanism.

Per DESIGN_NOTE_POOLING.md §2B: pooling is enforced **exactly**, never
approximated, at the level of a fully-sampled configuration — here, that
means a candidate genome's pool-membership choice for a given year, not any
compressed/summarized representation. If the proposed pool doesn't satisfy
every regulatory invariant, it is rejected outright (falls back to per-vessel
individual compliance that year via `compliance_cost.compute_fueleu_ledger`
with `pooled=False`) rather than partially or approximately honored.
