"""Exposure by flip-counting, priced in rupees (Task 2R component 5,
prototype version — implements PLAN.md §3.1's Exposure Map via §8.3(b)'s
classical validation method: "retraining per scenario and counting how often
each decision flips").

A decision is **exposed** if its optimal value differs across the K=5
scenario-optimal fleet plans (`solve_scenario`, component 4). Two integrity
requirements shape this module beyond the basic flip-count, both added after
review of the first version's numbers:

**Stability first (PLAN §8.3(c)'s principle, applied to GA seed variance).**
Every scenario is independently re-solved under `DEFAULT_STABILITY_SEEDS`
before anything is called "exposed" — at this component's original default
budget (population 40, 30 generations), roughly half of all decisions
disagreed between two runs of the *same* scenario differing only in random
seed, which would have made most of the original "113 exposed decisions"
uninterpretable GA noise rather than a real reading of the vote's economics.
A decision is reported only when every seed agrees on its value within each
scenario it's evaluated under; where seeds disagree, it's reported as
*unstable* and excluded from the exposed count instead of silently kept in
or silently dropped. Raising the GA's population/generation budget alone
does not make this go away past a point — even at population 300 (vs. the
default 200), the per-scenario two-seed disagreement rate on this fleet
plateaus around 38% rather than reaching zero, because a real fraction of
decisions sit in genuinely near-tied cost regions where multiple choices
cost almost the same; the stability filter is reporting that honestly
rather than an under-convergence artifact to be brute-forced away.

Requiring *unanimous* agreement across all `len(DEFAULT_STABILITY_SEEDS)`
seeds, independently in *every one* of the K=5 scenarios, compounds that
per-scenario rate into a much stricter bar than it looks at first: a
one-off production run at the full defaults (population 200, 200
generations, 3 seeds) on this fleet found only **2 of ~200 candidate
decisions stable enough to report as exposed** — the other 198 disagreed
across seeds somewhere in at least one scenario. That is not a bug in the
filter; it is the filter doing its job. It also means the "N stable exposed
decisions" count should be read as a lower bound produced by a strict,
honest criterion, not as "how many decisions the vote could plausibly
move" — a softer criterion (e.g. majority-of-seeds agreement) would surface
more decisions at the cost of weaker confidence in each one; this version
takes the stricter reading deliberately.

**Three outputs, not one summed total.** Per-decision capital-at-risk
figures are independent marginal deltas — each computed against the same
baseline plan with only *that one* decision swapped — and are not mutually
exclusive costs, so summing them across decision types double-counts
overlapping risk and mixes one-time capex with recurring opex-shaped deltas
(this module's first version did exactly that, and the resulting total
exceeded the entire fleet's five-year operating cost, which was the tell).
This version instead reports:

1. `plan_spread` — PLAN §3.1's actual headline "cost of regulatory
   uncertainty" number: max minus min of the K=5 scenarios' own
   *scenario-optimal total plan costs*. A single, non-overlapping figure.
2. `capex_exposure` — PLAN §3.1/§9.3's "X crore of capex is contingent on
   the vote" figure: capital-commitment decisions only. This prototype's
   genome models exactly one such decision (shore-power election); there is
   no `retrofit_year` variable yet (PLAN.md §5.4/Track F), so retrofit-type
   capex isn't represented here and the note says so.
3. `per_decision_deltas` — every stable exposed decision, all types, for
   drill-down tables only, carrying an explicit "do not sum" note.

Component 4's carbon-price sweep gives a free cross-check: since every
scenario in scenarios.json differs from the others only in its NZF
treatment, a decision that flips between two scenarios ought to have a
matching switching point somewhere between those scenarios' axis positions
in the sweep. Where it doesn't, that's a finding (a GA-convergence gap, or
an axis position built from a mechanism the uniform-price sweep doesn't
capture) reported rather than hidden.
