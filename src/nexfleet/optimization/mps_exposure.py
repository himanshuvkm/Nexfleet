"""The Exposure Map, computed for real from an actual Matrix Product State —
PLAN.md §3.1's own definition, not `exposure.py`'s classical flip-counting
proxy (which PLAN §8.3(b) describes as *this* method's validation check,
built first because the tensor method didn't exist yet).

**Scope of this iteration.** PLAN/DESIGN_NOTE_POOLING.md describe a single
fleet-wide MPS: 125 sites (24 vessels x 5 years, plus the regulatory leg),
genuinely entangled end to end. Building and *training* that object is a
Track F-scale effort (bond-dimension sweeps, DMRG-style optimization,
likely gradient-based amplitude fitting). This module instead builds one
**small, exact Born machine per vessel-year slot**: the regulatory leg `r`
(K=5) entangled with that one slot's own six `genome.DECISION_FIELDS`,
holding every other vessel-year fixed at an already-solved baseline plan —
the same "everything else held fixed" pattern `exposure.py`'s
`capex_exposure` already uses for its per-decision deltas. This is small
enough (a few hundred to a few thousand joint outcomes) to enumerate
*exactly* via `objective.evaluate` rather than search or train, and the
resulting joint tensor's mutual information is computed by
`tensor_network.py` with no approximation at this scale — a real answer to
a smaller question, not an approximate answer to the full one. Extending
this to a genuinely multi-vessel entangled chain (where bond-dimension
truncation starts to matter) is Track F.

**Where the probabilities come from.** For one vessel-year slot and one
scenario `r`, every combination of that slot's six decision fields is
enumerated, substituted into the baseline plan, and priced with
`objective.evaluate` (unchanged, pure). Costs become a **Boltzmann
distribution** `P(config | r) proportional-to exp(-(cost - min_cost) / T)`
— lower cost, higher probability, the standard way to turn an objective
function into a proper distribution over its own configuration space
without any training data. `P(r)` is uniform across the K=5 scenarios: an
explicit, documented assumption ("no prior over vote outcomes required",
PLAN §1.3), not a fitted or asserted belief about which proposal wins.

    Perf note: within one scenario's inner loop, every enumerated combo
    shares the *same* baseline value for the other ~32 vessel-year slots in
    `baseline_genome` -- only this one slot's trial gene changes. An
    `ObjectiveCache`, re-bound automatically every time `regulations`'
    identity changes (i.e. every scenario switch -- the standard "re-bound
