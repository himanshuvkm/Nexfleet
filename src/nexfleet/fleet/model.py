#: Task 2R component 3 correction 2: the original 65%-100% range never let
#: fuel cost (rising with V^2) and time cost (falling with 1/V) trade off to
#: an interior minimum for any of the three vessel bands — the unconstrained
#: optimum sits below 65% of design speed for all three given fleet.json's
#: anchor-energy/charter-premium figures, so the model degenerately parked at

#: curve has genuine curvature across its full domain; the two slowest of the
#: 8 bands stay outside the solver's actual reach via
#: `constraints.MIN_SPEED_BAND_INDEX`, so this widening does not by itself
