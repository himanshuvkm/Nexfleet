"""Smoke test for Next.js demo website structure and contracts.

Ensures:
1. No imports from `src/` inside the `frontend/` directory (strict presentation separation).
2. `scripts/build_demo_data.py` exists, is standalone orchestration, and produces outputs/demo_data.json and frontend/public/demo_data.json.
3. Frontend Next.js build succeeds cleanly without type errors.
