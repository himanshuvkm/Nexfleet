    Budget raised from 60s (item 5's original guide) after adding
    `solver._local_search_refine`'s coordinate-descent polish -- a real,
    verified fix for GA under-convergence (year-over-year fuel trajectories
    that reversed to a dirtier fuel with no cost benefit; see solver.py's
    docstring), not free. This test's fixture uses `run_sweep`'s cheapest
    default settings (population 40); the actual demo build always runs
    offline ahead of time against pre-seeded data (PLAN.md §8.8), never at
    interactive/demo-time, so this budget only bounds *build* time, not
    anything a judge waits on live.
