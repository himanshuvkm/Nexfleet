            The IMO — the UN body that regulates shipping — is due to reconvene on{' '}
            <strong className="text-[var(--text-primary)]">4 December 2026</strong> to decide on a global carbon
            price for merchant ships. A shipping company has to plan five years ahead: which vessel runs which
            route, how fast it sails, what fuel it burns, whether it plugs into shore power in port. Those
            decisions are locked in long before the vote lands, and they are worth very different amounts
            depending on how it goes.

          <p>
            For each of the {data.fleet.vessels.length} vessels, in each of the five years 2026–2030, it picks six
            things at once: the trade route, the cruising speed band, the fuel, whether to take shore power, and
            two FuelEU flexibility elections (pooling and borrowing). That is {data.fleet.vessels.length * 5}{' '}
            coupled decisions, each affecting the others through the fleet-wide cargo requirement and the
            compliance pool.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every plan it returns has already been checked twice: the fleet carries the cargo each route demands,
            and no vessel is asked to spend more days at sea than it physically has available.

          <p>
            Nothing runs on a quantum computer. The idea borrowed from quantum computing is the{' '}
            <em>representation</em>: instead of carrying a population of concrete candidate plans the way a
            genetic algorithm does, the solver carries a probability distribution over every single decision —
            the classical analogue of a superposition — and reshapes those distributions as it learns.
          </p>
          <p>
            That buys something a population of fixed plans structurally cannot have: each decision can be
            started off already knowing what the cost model implies about it, before any complete plan has been
            scored.{' '}

                , winning {scaleSummary.totalWins} of {scaleSummary.totalRuns} paired runs, with the margin
                widening from {scaleSummary.smallestFleet} to {scaleSummary.largestFleet} vessels.

            On a problem small enough to solve exactly by brute force, both solvers return the provable optimum —
            so the comparison is between two correct methods, not a correct one and a lucky one.

            The fleet is a documented ten-vessel case study built on published vessel-class figures; regulatory
            constants are transcribed from the regulation texts with retrieval dates, and bunker prices from
            dated market quotes. Every cost the optimizer reports carries a confidence label internally, and an
            aggregate is never reported as more confident than its weakest component.
