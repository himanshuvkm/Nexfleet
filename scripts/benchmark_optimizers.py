"""GA vs QIEA head-to-head benchmark — produces one comparison table.

Strictly orchestration, like `build_demo_data.py`: calls `run_sweep` and
`compute_exposure` directly under each optimizer at identical settings and
reports what came back. **Writes only to `outputs/optimizer_benchmark.{json,md}`
— never touches `outputs/demo_data.json` or `frontend/public/demo_data.json`.**
This is a decision-support run, not a demo-data build; the live demo is
untouched by running this.

Benchmark budget deliberately sits between `build_demo_data.py`'s `--fast`
and production settings: matches `tests/test_exposure.py::full_exposure`'s
fixture (already verified, elsewhere, to run in a few minutes and to
produce real, non-degenerate exposure results) rather than production's
20-30-minute budget, so this finishes in a reasonable time while still
being a meaningful, non-toy comparison. Re-run with larger settings before
trusting a close call.
