"""Fuel-consumption prediction benchmark (PS Objective 1 / experiment B1).

Physics baseline vs. LightGBM vs. MLP vs. tensor-train residual, leave-one-
vessel-out cross-validated on synthetic telemetry (`nexfleet.optimization.
synthetic_telemetry` — see that module's docstring for exactly what the
residual is and is not, and why the ground truth is synthetic: no real
AIS/ERA5/THETIS-MRV pipeline exists in this repo yet).

Strictly orchestration, like `benchmark_optimizers.py`: calls existing
functions from `nexfleet.optimization.{synthetic_telemetry,fuel_predictors}`
and reports what came back. **Writes only to
`outputs/fuel_predictor_benchmark.{json,md}` — never touches
`outputs/demo_data.json` or `frontend/public/demo_data.json`.**
